### Software Defined Quality of Service (SDQOS)
This is my grad project for the Telematics Engineering degree at PUCMM university. It enables Cisco devices (even very old ones) to have software defined quality of service capabilities. It allows for the quality of service configuration of those devices to be configured by software (code). On top of the main module that generate and sends the instructions to the router (the net.py module) we built a web-app that allows us to configure QoS settings using a beautiful interface.
